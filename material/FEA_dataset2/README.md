Mouse: induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) versus embryonic stem cells (ESCs)

Up: Dataset was filtered by q-value for 0.001 significance, then by log fold change with a threshold of 0.99 (~ two-fold change).
Down: Dataset was filtered by q-value for 0.001 significance, then by log fold change with a threshold of -0.99 (~ two-fold change).
Population set: All genes in the dataset.
